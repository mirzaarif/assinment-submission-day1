<h1>Northern India:</h1>    
<p> North India lies mainly on continental India, north of peninsular India.[citation needed][Which part lies on insular India?] Towards its north are the Himalayas which define the boundary between the Indian subcontinent and the Tibetan plateau. To its west is the Thar desert, shared between North India and Pakistan and the Aravalli Range, beyond which lies the state of Gujarat. The Vindhya mountains are, in some interpretations, taken to be the southern boundary of North India.

    The predominant geographical features of North India are:
    
    the Indo-Gangetic plain, which spans the states and union territories of Chandigarh, Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh
    the Himalayas, which lie in the states of Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, and Jammu and Kashmir;
    the Thar desert, which lies mainly in the state of Rajasthan.
    The states of Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Jammu and Kashmir also have a large forest   </p>
    <h3>General climate:</h3>
    <p> North India lies mainly in the north temperate zone of the Earth.[29] Though cool or cold winters,hot summers and moderate monsoons are the general pattern. 
        North India is one of the most climatically diverse regions on Earth. During summer, the temperature often rises above 35 °C across much of the Indo-Gangetic plain, reaching as high as 50 °C in the Thar desert, Rajasthan and up to 49 in Delhi. During winter, the lowest temperature on the plains dips to below 5 °C, and below the freezing point in some states. Heavy to moderate snowfall occurs in Himachal Pradesh, J&K and Uttarakhand. Much of North India is notorious for heavy fog during winters.
        Extreme temperatures among inhabited regions have ranged from −45 °C (−49 °F) in Dras, Jammu and Kashmir[30] to 50.6 °C (123 °F) in Alwar, Rajasthan. Dras is claimed to be the second-coldest inhabited place on the planet (after Siberia), with a recorded low of -60 °C. </p>

<h1>East India:</h1>
<p>East India is a region of India consisting of the Indian states of Bihar,[1] Jharkhand,[2] Odisha[3] and West Bengal[4] and also the union territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.[5] The region roughly corresponds to the historical region of Magadha from which it inherits its various Eastern Indo-Aryan languages.
    The states of Bihar and West Bengal lie on the Indo-Gangetic plain. Jharkhand is situated on the Chota Nagpur Plateau. Odisha lies on the Eastern Ghats and the Deccan Plateau. West Bengal's capital Kolkata is the largest city of this region. The Kolkata Metropolitan Area is the country's third largest.
    The region is bounded by Bhutan, Nepal and the state of Sikkim in the north, the states of Uttar Pradesh and Chhattisgarh on the west, the state of Andhra Pradesh in the south and the country of Bangladesh in the east. It is also bounded by the Bay of Bengal in the south-east. It is connected to the Seven Sister States of Northeast India by the narrow Siliguri Corridor in the north east of West Bengal.    
    The region was ruled by several empires, including Gangaridai, Nandas, Mauryans, Guptas, Palas, Senas, Eastern Gangas, Gajapatis, Delhi Sultanate, Bengal Sultanate, Mughal Empire and the British Empire.

<p>During the Neolithic period, agriculture started in South Asia.
     Neolithic settlements have been found in Chirand. In the Kabra-Kala mound at the confluence of the Son and North Koel rivers in Palamu district, various antiquities and art objects from the Neolithic to medieval periods have been found; the pot-sherds of redware, black and red ware, black ware, black slipped ware, and NBP ware are from the Chalcolithic to late medieval periods.
     There are ancient cave paintings in Isko, Hazaribagh district, from the Meso-chalcolithic period (9,000–5,000 BC).[7] From Kuchai, near Baripada, various Neolithic tools like hoes, chisels, pounders, mace heads, grinding stones and also pieces of pottery.
     Prehistoric paintings and inscriptions have also been found in Garjan Dongar in Sundergarh district, and Ushakothi in Sambalpur district and Vimkramkhol in Jharsuguda district.[10][11] There has been an uncertainty about the inscriptions at Ushakothi and Vimkramkhol regarding whether they are in a proto-Brahmi script.[12] Yogimath near Khariar has cave paintings from the Neolithic.[12][13] There is Chalcolithic sites in Pandu Rajar Dhibi in the lower Ajay valley in West Bengal. Iron slag, microliths, and potsherds from 1400 BCE, according to carbon dating, were discovered in Singhbhum district.[14] During the late Vedic period, several janapadas emerged in India. In the 6th century BCE, the mahajanapadas emerged in several parts of the Indian subcontinent.

    <h1>West india</h1>
    <p>This region has some of the country's most popular destinations. In Rajasthan, the desert forts of Jaisalmer and the magnificent sand-dunes evoke all the romance and splendour of its princely past. Gujarat's Jain temples and intricately designed stepwells are architectural marvels, while its natural beauty can be enjoyed on the beaches of Diu.

        The landscape in the West varies from the sand-dunes of Rajasthan to the vast salts of the Kutch, to the urban bustle of Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Surat, etc.</p>
